Architectural Elite is an Architectural and Engineering Recruitment company
operating globally. Architectural Elite are a consultative recruitment agency
providing businesses with the staff they need or the jobs they want! They have
no gimmicks, no fancy strap lines, they are not the ‘biggest’ and don’t deal with
everyone.

The project involved redesigning and updating the current Archtitectural Elite website, we had to research other recruitment websites, look at design trends, sketch out rough ideas and improve on them. We then had to create medium fidelity wireframes which were then taken to high fidelity as a final design.


The main goal of the site is to attract candidates for jobs and get them to
upload their CV. The secondary goal for the site is to attract businesses looking
to recruit architectural and engineering candidates.
The current site is outdated, doesn’t convert well and doesn’t work well on
mobile devices.

Primary Objectives
To increase the number of CV being uploaded to the website enabling
Architectural Elite to build a candidate database.
Secondary Objectives
To show businesses looking to recruit with Architectural Elite reasons why they
should choose them to fill their roles and providing them with an easy way to
get in contact.
